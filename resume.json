      "description": "The project aims at pursuing a broader adoption of serverless computing technologies within the European software industry. One of RADON’s key pillars is quality assurance tools for Infrastructure-as-Code. As part of the RADON framework, the Defect Prediction tool (https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-defuse) developed during the PhD focuses on IaC correctness. It consists of several components to mine open-source repositories to identify failure data and to extract quality metrics to guide the empirical training and enrichment of the models for defect prediction as well as predict code smells and errors in IaC files. Although instantiated in the context of infrastructure as code, the defect predictor was envisioned and designed to be language-agnostic.",
